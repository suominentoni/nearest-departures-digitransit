# Nearest Departures Digitransit

A Swift framework for fetching transit data from the Digitransit API (https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/). Written initially for the Nearest Departures Finland app ([Download for iOS and Apple Watch](https://itunes.apple.com/fi/app/hsl-lahimmat-lahdot/id1137708015?mt=8)). The API was by no means originally written for general use, but specifically for the Nearest Departures app only. However, I decided to put it out in the open, in case someone finds it usefull. Additionally, I'll try to develop it towards a more generic framework.
