# Nearest Departures Digitransit

A Swift framework for fetching transit data from the Digitransit API (https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/). Written initially for the Nearest Departures Finland app ([Download for iOS and Apple Watch](https://itunes.apple.com/fi/app/hsl-lahimmat-lahdot/id1137708015?mt=8) or see the [source code](https://github.com/suominentoni/nearest-departures)). The API was not originally written for general use, but specifically for the Nearest Departures app only. However, I decided to put it out in the open, in case someone finds it useful. Additionally, I'll try to develop it towards a more generic framework. Feel free to contribute!

Transit data provided by [Digitransit](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/).
